# Py_Delete_empty_folders
Just a small script that I created to clean up a bunch of empty folders on my Mac


I look for the .DS_Store file that OS X creates (in order to save the folder view preferences and other stuff) and delete it before attempting to delete the folder since I am using a command that only deletes empty folders (just in case)
